A workout schedule builder app built with React  
https://exercise-planner-delanaeini.web.app/

## Description

This peoject has a button that opens a form-modal where the user can select the day, write the exercise name, and optionally, add the number of sets and reps they wish to achieve for that exercise. After submitting the form, the modal closes and the user can then see the exercise and the number of sets and reps (if the included any) on their selected day in the week. This project can be used as a week module in any bigger app that requires input in a specific day of the week.
